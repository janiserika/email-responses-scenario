Hi Pia,

We recognize your reason for incurring absences that led to your policy-related withdrawal from the course. We usually give second chances for students with extenuating circumstances; however, it seems that you have an overwhelming load for the semester and have a full schedule due to work. We understand your eagerness in continuing the program despite your busy school and work schedule, but we also do not want you to be overworked.

We are very sorry for declining your request. If you are still interested, you can take the course next semester when you have less load and better availability. You can sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) so that you can receive updates regarding the course. Thank you for your understanding.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
