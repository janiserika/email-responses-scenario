Hi Ranchodas,

Thank you for informing us about your situation. As you requested, we have moved you to an **Observer** role.

Here is a list to help you better understand what it means to be an Observer to the course:

1.	You have **lifetime access** to the course material and you can study it at your own pace.
2.	There are **no due dates** or any expectation imposed by us.
3.	You will be invited to our [mailing list]( https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive updates on upcoming courses and events.

Thank you for your interest in the course, and congratulations on being accepted as an intern in Microsoft.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
